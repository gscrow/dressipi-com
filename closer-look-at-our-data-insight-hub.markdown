Dressipi CEO Sarah McVittie takes a closer look at how our Data Insight dashboards can help you to easily visualise your data, spot quick wins to ensure you are always trading as effectively as possible, drive more effective CRM strategies and pinpoint the quickest way to reduce your return rates. They are genuinely actionable, customised to each retailer’s requirements and will make a real difference to your bottom line.

In the below video you will learn how our dashboards can help you:

1) Trade more effectively from week to week
2) Optimise your marketing and CRM strategies
3) Manage stock availability and size fragmentation
4) Find out what is driving returns, and ways to reduce them
5) Benchmark your company against your peers
