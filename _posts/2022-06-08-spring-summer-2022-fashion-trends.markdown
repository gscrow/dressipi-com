---

## From tricky trends to spring/summer favourites, what trends your customers are buying into and how they’re wearing them is integral in how our Dressipi data helps to inspire merchandising each season. 

A trend is a set of garment features. Each feature works on its own (eg. prints: florals) or collectively in a group to capture and reflect a mood of the new season. It might be a single item of clothing or the way an entire look is styled. This is one of the reasons why our fashion-specific data on garments matters. Retailers can identify what % of trend garment features are driving what % of revenue and whether or not it is a single feature or a collection of features, as well as what the customer is likely to buy into.

Fashion-specific data on garments is crucial when it comes to mapping and unravelling trends. Bold brights, our favourite summer whites and perennial florals bring nothing new to the seasonal spring/summer palettes. But how to wear and ‘will you wear?’ top-to-toe color, whether you highlight or not with accents of neon and where those on-trend cut-out details might be placed, do.

How much is too much? If the catwalks were anything to go by flesh baring cut-out details are not for the feint hearted. Saint Laurent spiced up bodycon lycra bodysuits with slashed out fabrics at the waist and bust; the whimsical Alberta Ferretti went all Grecian goddess with swathes of fabric draped to reveal toned tummies and tanned shoulders and Valentino gave structural cut-out waist detail dimensions to a punchy pink mini dress. But how much is too much especially when dresses are not reserved simply for evening bashes? This style inspiration has tended to be more user-friendly and toned down and consumers do seem to be partial to the catwalk inspired flashes of flesh for summer. Percentage of total dress revenue sees cut-out-at-waist detail dresses up from 0.59% May 2021 to 2.24% May 2022.

When it comes to dresses bold brights – from plain to prints - always a trusty summer wardrobe pick-me-up are seeing a steady rise, up from 16% total dress revenue in 2019 to 19% 2022 and as we head into summer holidays no doubt expected to rise. But bright colors this season are not just about the versatile joy of a throw-on-and-go dress. Separates and suiting - Dior and Prada - offer a bold alternative to the dress. And here it’s all in the way this trend is worn. Are your customers going down the top-to-color-blocking route? Do they have a preference for a monotone take on the trend or do they favour bold clashing shades?
