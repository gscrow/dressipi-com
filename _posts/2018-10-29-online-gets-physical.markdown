More and more of the industry's key online players are popping up as temporary bricks-and-mortar stores. Natalie Theo, Dressipi's Style Director visited Amazon's new pop-up to explore how they manage to replicate that exceptional online customer experience, in a physical space.

# Amazon Gets Physical

Popping up all over the place in temporary albeit seductive bricks-and-mortar incarnations are some of the industry’s key online players. They’re not just stopping at uber-stylish retail spaces - they are layering on a high octane dose of experience, experience and more experience.

In celebration of its 10th anniversary (they have an LA store), Gwyneth Paltrow’s GOOP hit the streets of Notting Hill complete with a plush interior designed townhouse and Instagram worthy launch dinner that even if you don’t buy anything will leave you dipping into the site on a daily basis for a bit of voyeuristic wellness.

Amazon has billed their latest pop-up shop, ‘Amazon Fashion Hosts,’ as:

*“A ‘first of its kind’ pop-up shopping experience offering the latest trends for the season….showcasing a different curation of men’s and women’s fashion items and top brands every other day, and hosting an array of talent with activities throughout the week to excite and entertain its visitors”.*

Supermodel Lara Stone and radio and TV presenter Nick Grimshaw helped kickstart things at a star-studded launch that shouted out, “We’re here. We’re cool. We’re stylish. Shop us live”.

Why go to an ‘off the beaten shopping path’ corner of Baker Street to buy and browse pieces from Amazon when you can scroll online from the comfort of your own home whilst wondering who’ll win Bake Off? Because sometimes a curated edit of fashion that showcases trends and key pieces and takes the hassle out of the continuous online trawl is just the nudge you need to convert you from browser to buyer. After all, that animal print New Look dress you never knew was stocked on Amazon has more hanger appeal IRL than online.

Because a sold-out before you blinked beauty trends talk with Vogue double-validates that purchase you were hesitating about making. And if anyone’s going to get you to sign up to and buy into the wellness trend then it’s a yoga session in the Amazon pop-up with none other than Ella from Deliciously Ella. *“It’s about creating customer interest in Amazon’s wide range of products”*, said one of the stylists in-store.

That New Look dress really did look ‘in context’ in the pop-up shop as did a stylish animal print red skirt. Customers with the Amazon app can scan the barcode and order for home delivery (leaving them handsfree for the rest of their shopping day), or snap up the item straight away in-store.  It was easy to use and with an effortless click I could buy the dress and it would arrive straight to my door - that’s great [customer experience](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_y_njgfUdbg). (Just for the record, I didn’t buy it - I already have an animal print dress, but that skirt, on the other hand, is still in the checkout basket in my mind!)

I have yet to visit Gwyneth’s GOOP, but as a Vestiaire seller, I will definitely be going to Vestiaire Collective’s two-week pop-up shop in Selfridge’s where customers can shop and sell pre-owned luxury IRL.  Popping-up is all very much about the art of seduction these days and part of the appeal is looking to see what [great experiences](https://dressipi.com/solutions/product-experience/) in this competitive industry retailers are going to make accessible to us. It’s the online players greatest calling card.
