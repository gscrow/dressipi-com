# Dressipi 1M Fashion Sessions Dataset

## Download Dressipi's public dataset that was used in the RecSys Challenge 2022.

[ACM RecSys](https://recsys.acm.org/) is the premier annual conference in Recommender Systems. In 2022 Dressipi had the honour of hosting the RecSys Challenge and setting a prediction task for participants to solve. Teams had to predict which fashion item would be bought at the end of a session. Over 250 teams from academia and industry participated in the challenge. Details of the Challenge and a description of the dataset can be found [here](http://www.recsyschallenge.com/2022/) and [here](http://www.recsyschallenge.com/2022/dataset.html).
