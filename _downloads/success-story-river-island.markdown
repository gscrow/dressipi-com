    subtitle: 
    body: "River Island is one of the UK’s leading fashion retailers. Generating millions
      of pounds of annual revenue, the brand boasts over 350 stores worldwide and
      six dedicated online sites operating in four currencies. \n\nRiver Island believed
      that personalization could make a difference to their customer experiences and
      in turn, their online revenue. Despite this, they were struggling to see any
      material difference with the two generic personalization providers they were
      using. \n\nThey wanted to explore other options.\n"
  - title: Apparel-specific personalization provides a better customer experience

    body: "River Island were intrigued by Dressipi’s fashion focussed approach and
      understood that a fashion focus vs a generic approach was likely to provide
      a much better experience to customers.\n\nThe team wanted to test Dressipi’s
      personalization in a very simple, light touch way and so decided to start with
      personalization on the womenswear Product Listing Page (PLP). \n\nThe team at
      River Island didn’t consider it could make such a big difference. The initial
      results surprised - Dressipi outperformed the 2 other generic providers with
      a 3% increase in revenue per visitor.\n"

    quote: "“Fashion is a really complex vertical with so many moving parts. We have
      to contend with seasonality and trends, and that’s before we even layer on personal
      preferences. We saw an uplift in the Dressipi segment and saw a worse performance
      vs our control in the recommendation engine that wasn’t in the fashion vertical,
      so the non Dressipi variant was actually having a detrimental impact on performance”"

      Given the success of the initial test, River Island were then prepared to extend personalization to all parts of the customer journey and expand across their menswear and kidswear categories.

      Since then the partnership has gone from strength to strength. Rolling out personalized outfits and similar items on the Product Description Page and PLP saw results get better and better increasing revenue from the initial 3% to 6% in just 12 months, increasing AOV by 5% and increasing conversion by 3%.

        customer but on our teams as well, the time frames that we can turn these
        emails around are quicker than if we were to send a normal trade email. After
        the success of having Dressipi within our BAU emails, we’re looking at ways
        we can explore other use cases with emails. As part of a retention and acquisition
        plan, we’re looking at how we can talk to customers post-purchase by using
        Dressipi’s outfit recommendations.”"

        emails with exceptional results. Click-Through Rates on average against the
        control group are up around 34% with a Click-to-Open Rate increase of 52%.
        For sessions that hit the site, there is an average conversion increase of

      body: "From implementing personalization on the front end, it became apparent
        that there was new access to data that did not exist before. This was not
        only useful to the commerce team but also many other parts of the business.
        The different approach to the data with a customer lens and product specific
        lens were especially helpful for the buying and merchandising teams.\n\nRiver
        Island are hugely excited about what the future holds with the full Dressipi
        ecommerce partnership as they can see the growth isn't static but exponential.
        \ \n"
    quote: "“We have huge amounts more to explore with Dressipi. The bit that really
      excites me is how we come together on insights. Getting beyond personalization
      has really helped us understand our customer base and what they want and need.”"
