    subtitle: 
    body: "As a leading UK womenswear retailer, Seasalt Cornwall inspires women of all ages and shapes to dress with 
      creativity and confidence. Although stores remain core to Seasalt’s customer experience proposition, their 
      online growth has accelerated and ecommerce sales have increased significantly.
      \n
      \nThey were looking for a partner to deliver the same level of experience to their loyal customers online as they 
      do in their stores.
      \n
      \nIn store, an assistant could discuss style preferences, sizing and the current trends with a customer. The 
      generic personalization solutions they’d tried for their ecommerce store didn’t take into account this 
      complexity, and the results fell short of what was needed.\n"

    body: "Working with Dressipi, Seasalt Cornwall had found a partner whose personalization software was designed 
      specifically for fashion - understanding the impact of seasonality, trends, taste, body shapes etc.\n"
    quote: "“Having a technology partner specifically focused on fashion is hugely 
      beneficial to our P&L and has also helped us discover new digital 
      opportunities across the whole customer journey.”"

    body: "Using Dressipi, the Digital Team at Seasalt Cornwall launched personalized similar items and outfits on their 
      Product Description Pages.
      \n
      \nNow, every visitor coming to their website is shown personalized outfits and styling recommendations, based 
      on their unique preferences. They're able to provide inspiration to their customers by showing the versatility of 
      a garment for different occasions, whether that be 'Casual' or 'Creative Work'.\n"
